# Le-Grand-Forecast
A sales predictor for Le Grand Bistro Americain using time-series analysis of the restaurants sales and incorporating local weather patterns. Useful for both front and back of house cost estimations as an aid for staffing and food preparation.

Data Collection
Dinerware is housed in a Microsoft SQL Server Database (2012). By querying this database for the ticket sales across a 4 year period, I was able to see per transaction results. 
Using this to derive overall sales and lunch / dinner breakdowns showed quantitative trends over the course of individual days, weeks, and years.

Metar data was collected from Seattle's Boeing Airfield via Iowa State University's Mesonet <url>.
